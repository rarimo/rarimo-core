# Smart-contracts overview

Rarimo smart-contracts are the primary way to interact with our multi-chain protocol.
Developers can send data, assets, or liquidity; build cross-chain integrations; or retrieve protocol information using these contracts.
Whenever possible, we made sure to maintain similar interface and signatures to make integrating cross-chain easy.
