# `x/evm`

## Abstract

EVM module was copy-pasted from `evmos/ethermint` project.
The goal of EVM module is to provide Solidity smart contracts support into the Cosmos-based core.

You can find the full specification for that module here: `https://github.com/rarimo/rarimo-core/tree/master/x/evm/spec`
Also, EVM module works in couple with `feemarket` module that has been designed to support EIP1559 in Cosmos-SDK.
The `feemarket` module doc: `https://github.com/rarimo/rarimo-core/tree/master/x/feemarket/spec`.

## Notes

### Accounts

To use Cosmos accounts in EVM the basic go implementation (Cosmos BaseAccount) was replaced with `ethermint.EthAccount`.
All accounts generated by CLI or created on-chain by token transfer will be stored in that wrapper.

### Ports

Use `app.toml` to edit the following EVM configuration:

- Address defines the EVM RPC HTTP server address to bind to.

  `address = "0.0.0.0:8545"`

- Address defines the EVM WebSocket server address to bind to.

  `ws-address = "0.0.0.0:8546"`
