# `x/oraclemanager`

## Abstract

The `oraclemanager` cosmos module contains logic for managing distibuted public oracles that supports our bridge by
delivering
information about transfers.

----

## Concepts

In the `oraclemanager` the oracles will be organized into the groups for every supported chain.
Of course, we imply that the same account can be the oracle in several groups.

Also, oracle will have the following related data:

- Status: Slashed, Freezed, Jailed, Active and Inactive
- Stake amount
- Missed count - the count of missed vote
- Violations count - the count of possible_malicious
- Freeze end block - the block when an oracle becomes slashed.
- Voted operations
- Created operations

The following list full describes system rules and architecture:

1. There will be configured the following parameters:
    - min_oracle_stake - minimum amount of RMO tokens to become an oracle.
    - check_op_delta - the amount of blocks after operation voting finish to perform slashing of malicious oracles (
      described below in 6).
    - max_violation_count - the amount of violation that an oracle can reach before it will be freezed (described below
      in 6).
    - max_missed_count - the amount of violation that oracle can reach before it will be jailed (described below in 6).
    - slashed_freeze_blocks - the amount of blocks until the oracle stake will be burned (described below in 7).
    - min_oracles_count - minimal count of oracles to verify operations on the certain chain (global for all chains).

2. Oracles will be separated to the lists of accounts that support certain chains (chains defined in params
   of `tokenmanager` module).
   So every chain will have their own list of oracles that observes its state, submits and votes for operations.

3. To become an oracle for a certain chain account (that will be used by oracle service) should stake
   at least min_oracle_stake tokens through the `oraclemanager` by submitting the `Stake` transaction.
   To use the same oracle account for several chains, the account owner should stake tokens for every chain separately.

4. It is possible to unstake tokens and finish taking part in voting and creating new operations if the oracle owner
   wants.
   Through the `oraclemanager` oracle owner can submit `Unstake` transaction and return the staked coins.
   After that oracle will not be able to create operations and vote for the created one.

5. After staking, if the chain has at least min_oracles_count oracles, every oracle can create and vote for new
   operations,
   using the proxy method in `oraclemanager` (`CreateTransferOperation` and `Vote` that will trigger logic in
   the `rarimocore` module).
   Oracle voting power will be calculated depending on the oracle account staked tokens amount.

6. The `oraclemanager` will control votes and new operations to perform slashing of malicious oracles.
   For every operation that has Approved or NotApproved status after check_op_delta blocks `oraclemanager` EndBlock
   method will iterate over all votes and:
    - Increase missed counter for oracles that haven't submitted their Vote.
    - Increase violations counter for oracles that have submitted a `Vote` with answer `NO` for `Approved` operation.
    - Increase violations counter for oracles that have submitted a `Vote` with answer `YES` for `NotApproved`
      operation.
    - Increase violations counter for oracles that have created a `NotApproved` operation.

Also, EndBlock method will iterate over all oracles and:

- if oracle reaches max_violation_count its status will be set as `Freezed`. Freezed oracle accounts will not be able to
  create operations and vote for the created one.
- if oracle reaches max_missed_count its status will be set as `Jailed`. Jailed oracle accounts will not be able to
  create operations and vote for the created one.

7. After freezing the oracle owner can create a proposal to unfreeze his account
   (`CreateOracleUnfreezeProposal` transaction on `oraclemanager` module) and if it becomes accepted the oracle account
   will become `Active` with zero violations count.
   If after slashed_freeze_blocks from freezing the proposal was not created or
   accepted the oracle stake will be burned and that oracle account never will not be able to return its stake or
   become an active oracle.

8. For the `Jailed` oracles, the oracle owner should execute the `Unjail` transaction.

## Transactions

chain format.
Other data should be formatted into hex with `0x` prefix.

```protobuf
message MsgCreateTransferOp {
  string creator = 1;
  // Information to identify transfer
  string tx = 2;
  string eventId = 3;
  string sender = 4;

  string receiver = 5;
  string amount = 6;
  string bundleData = 7;// hex-encoded
  string bundleSalt = 8;// hex-encoded

  rarimo.rarimocore.tokenmanager.OnChainItemIndex from = 9;
  rarimo.rarimocore.tokenmanager.OnChainItemIndex to = 10;
  rarimo.rarimocore.tokenmanager.ItemMetadata meta = 11; // Optional (if item currently does not exists)
}
```
